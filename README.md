# 👋 Hi there, I'm Arley

I'm a Biologist (Ph.D.) with a strong interest in mosquito-borne diseases, arbovirology, parasitology and vector biology. I combine molecular biology, entomology, and bioinformatics to explore host-pathogen-vector interactions — with a focus on mosquitoes.

### 🔬 Current Research Focus
- **Transcriptomics and epigenetics**: Bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and scATAC-seq.
- **Virome studies**: Viral discovery in mosquitoes using metagenomics.
- **Insect-pathogen interactions**: Exploring how virus and parasites influence mosquito biology.

### 💻 Technical Skills
- Programming: `R`, `Python`, `SQL`
- Workflow managers: `Snakemake`, `Nextflow`, `bash`
- Bioinformatics tools: `DESeq2`, `edgeR`, `Limma`, `Seurat`, `biopython`, `samtools`, `SPAdes`, `etc...`

### 📁 Repositories you'll find here
- 🧪 Research notebooks and reproducible pipelines.
- 📊 Simulated (toy) and real datasets from vector biology.
- 📝 Technical notes, code snippets, and tutorials.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- Spatial transcriptomics.
- Integration of ML into public health research.

I'm building this space as a living research notebook and scientific portfolio — feel free to reach out or connect!
